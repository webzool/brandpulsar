                    Brandable names are catchy, unique, and meaningful identifications for businesses. It is more than
                    the mere description
                    of the offered services or products. Brandable names have the power to create a whole new image for
                    the company and sell
                    it to customers at the speed of the light. Such names can be made names with no previous meanings or
                    use areas such as
                    Google or Instagram. Even if people are familiar with the definition, brandable names utilize the
                    words in new concepts
                    and communicate creative, inspirational messages, such as Apple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sometimes, a word can have no meaning, but the way it sounds is enough to communicate a message to
                    the customers. In
                    general, getting a brandable name is one of the biggest favours you can do for the success of your
                    business.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Relatable - through its sound and meaning, a brandable name signals the use, benefit and values
                        without clearly
                        describing them.</li>
                    <li>Distinct - branded names are different from your competitors, and they create a unique brand
                        image for your company.
                    </li>
                    <li>Memorable - your clients should have no difficulty to recall, type or pronounce the name.
                    </li>
                    <li>Reliable - the name sounds professional and accountable even if it utilizes a creative approach.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Why are Brandable Names Important?</h3>
                <p>
                    If you want to create strong bonds with the potential customers, brandable names are the best.. The
                    benefits of
                    brandable names are immense:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Create a Distinct Image</li>
                    <p>A name like ‘cheap computers’ might be tempting for short term sales, but it will fail in the
                        creation of a long term
                        relationship with the clients. Such names do not give you a competitive edge when there exist
                        many other rivals with
                        similar offerings. Instead, brandable names can catch the attention and help to sell affordable
                        computers quicker than
                        others.</p>
                    <li>Get Much Flexibility</li>
                    <p>When it comes to business expansion ideas, brandable names are the best. Think about the names
                        with keywords, such as
                        ‘XYZ Laptops’. What happens if you decide to sell more gadgets, like smartphones, tablets, or
                        watches? Names with
                        keywords will be a barrier in new product development, or market expansions. However, brandable
                        names will fit many
                        concepts easily with no adjustments.</p>
                    <li>Avoid Legalities</li>
                    <p>Brandable names are mostly innovative and non-existent words, such as Yahoo. Hence, there is a
                        very low chance that once
                        you get it, you will face any legal challenges. Besides, as it is not generic, you can get the
                        trademark with less
                        effort. Protecting your domain and company name will also be a piece of cake for many years to
                        come.</p>

                <h3>How to Create a Brandable Name?</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Keep It Short</li>
                    <p>If you want to have a fantastic brand image, forget about long strings of text for your company
                        name. It is one of the
                        common mistakes of companies as they want to add every benefit and value to the name. Besides,
                        adding keywords looks
                        attractive as it will promote the search engine ranking. However, you need to get a short name -
                        with a maximum of 2-3
                        words. In this way, it will be easy for clients to memorize and recall.
                    </p>
                    <li>Don’t Copycat</li>
                    <p>When you enter a new industry, it is tempting to follow the steps of successful players. Sure, a
                        competitive analysis
                        can bring naming ideas, but copying the trends is not a useful strategy. In this case, your
                        business will be one of the
                        many similar options. It will disappear in the competition and be invisible to the clients. A
                        completely new, distinct
                        name will give your business a durable competitive edge.
                    </p>
                    <li>Avoid Excessive Creativity</li>
                    <p>While we always recommend going ‘out-of-box’ and coming up with unique ideas, some people can
                        overreact to this
                        principle. Too much creativity can make the name complicated for the users. You need to keep the
                        balance between being
                        different and similar. It means, even if your name has unclear meanings, it should still have
                        easy spelling and
                        pronunciation. Otherwise, customers who are afraid of mispronouncing your brand will avoid
                        talking about your brand to
                        others.
                    </p>
                    <li>Not You, But They</li>
                    <p>
                        In all stages of the name selection process, you need to keep the clients in mind. It is easy to
                        get carried away and
                        choose names that sound appealing to you. However, you should not forget that what is important
                        is the customers’
                        perception and opinion. Do the research and try to understand the preferences of your target
                        audience. If you like some
                        names, share with your potential clients and get their feedback.
                    </p>
                    <li>Be consistent</li>
                    <p>
                        When you decide on the name, you need to ensure that you can get a domain, social media
                        addresses and emails with the
                        same title. Having a consistent image offers a better user experience and creates a reliable,
                        professional image for the
                        company. Your clients can access your website and social media accounts, or contact you by email
                        if they keep the simple
                        information-your business name- in their minds. Such simplicity strengthens the bonds between
                        the brand and the
                        customer.

                    <li>Competition? Never Heard.</li>
                    <p>One of the most important rules of choosing the brandable name is that you should not ignore the
                        competition. Even if
                        your ultimate goal is being distinct, you need to check the competitors’ names first. In this
                        way, you can find out what
                        names are becoming quickly famous or what features lead to failure. After analyzing your rivals,
                        get a unique name with
                        some of the elements from their names. As a result, you will avoid blending in with similar
                        names while having a
                        relatable, familiar image. Besides, your brand will stand out in the competition.
                    </p>
                    <li>Marketing at Its Best</li>
                    <p>You can either choose an existing word and use a different concept or invent a new word for a
                        brandable name. The latter
                        one has many benefits such as avoiding legal charges, being unique and appealing for the
                        customers. However, if you do
                        not market your name and its meaning for your business, people will not care about your brand.
                        You need to ensure that
                        your logo style, colours, sounds - all brand elements create a coherent image with your name.
                        This process can take much
                        time and effort. Yet, once you achieve the high-level awareness for your invented name,
                        customers will not forget about
                        your brand for a long time.
