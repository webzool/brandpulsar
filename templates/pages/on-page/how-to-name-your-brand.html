                <p>Choosing the right name for your business is essential. It is one of the valuable assets that can
                    bring immense benefits
                    to your business. A name is a powerful tool, and it can indicate who leads the industry, which
                    company is the most
                    innovative or creative in the market. You should not underestimate what you can achieve with the
                    proper name and invest
                    much time and effort to choose the best one.
                </p>
                <p>Brands with catchy and ‘out-of-box’ names generate buzz among the people. Such buzz aids companies to
                    stand out in the
                    competition. Therefore, a common name has a high risk of making the business sound like every other
                    competitor. In the
                    worst case, the wrong name can backlash and create a negative attitude toward the brand. No worries
                    tho; in this short
                    guide, we will show you what goes into coming up with a fascinating domain name. Let’s dive into it!
                </p>
                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>Before delving into the effective strategies for naming, we need to remind you of the power of the
                    research. We can
                    provide countless naming options for your brand. However, the right name depends on the external and
                    internal conditions
                    your company faces. You need first to understand what the naming strategies of your main competitors
                    are. Find an answer
                    to questions like:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do your competitors use short names or long ones?</li>
                    <li>Do they use descriptive or creative names?</li>
                    <li>How do the names reflect their offerings, core values or benefits?</li>
                    <li>How did the weak competitors name their brands?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Besides, getting the recommendations from potential clients will ensure that you choose a name that
                    they will like. You
                    can make a small focus group interview or contact directly with the clients to get their opinions
                    about existing brands:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Do the existing clients favour naming strategies of your competitors?</li>
                    <li>What does your potential client base think about your list of alternative names?</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Lastly, you need to be well-aware of your internal goals in naming. Think about your business. You
                    can be an innovative
                    soul in a long-established, traditional industry. Hence, following the strategies of your
                    competitors would not make any
                    sense. Your name should reflect the identity of your business:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How do you want your clients to feel when they hear your brand name?</li>
                    <li>Which basic emotions or personalities can fit your business?</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Popular Naming Strategies</h3>
                <p>There exist several techniques that help business owners to choose a successful brand name easily.
                    These are general
                    strategies that allow flexibility and adjustments. However, they all have different advantages and
                    disadvantages
                    depending on the industry type, target audience or the offerings of your business.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Using the Names or Surnames of Owners</li>
                    <p>Some companies skip all the hassle of decision making for the name, and use their surnames for
                        the company. Such a
                        method is, sure, straightforward and saves a lot of time and effort for the business owners. In
                        fact, established
                        companies with the founder’s or manager’s name create a professional look. However, for a
                        start-up project, this method
                        might not be the best one. The drawback of such naming is that it does not communicate a message
                        to a customer when the
                        name owner is not especially famous.
                    </p>
                    <li>Descriptive Names</li>
                    <p>One of the most useful naming strategies is to come up with single or multiple words that
                        describe the business. Such
                        names signal what your business is all about. You can use your brand values, primary goals,
                        service or product category,
                        and industry type in the name. In this way, you will communicate a meaningful message to your
                        customers. The
                        disadvantage of this method is that it is too apparent. Descriptive names directly speak for the
                        brand and leave no
                        place for mysterious or intriguing feelings.
                    </p>
                    <li>Names with Hidden Meanings</li>
                    <p>Speaking of intriguing people, you can choose a name with hidden meaning. This strategy is quite
                        famous, and it involves
                        finding ancient words or names in different languages which have a relatable sense. At first
                        glance, your customers will
                        not understand what your name means. However, if you explain the meaning of, for example, an
                        ancient word in a way that
                        is meaningful to your business, it can amaze your target audience. For instance, if your
                        business requires creativity,
                        you can find a word which is related to the creation, the beginning of life, or change.
                    </p>
                    <li>Making Up Names</li>
                    <p>Another common strategy for naming a brand is creating new names that did not exist before. For
                        example, Google has no
                        other meaning besides being the company name. Such a technique has many advantages. First, for
                        innovative and young
                        businesses, making up new words signal their benefits. Second, finding a domain name or getting
                        the legal rights for the
                        name will be quite easy because you are the first one who came up with this word. The only
                        downside of this technique is
                        that people might not memorize or recall your name easily if you do not promote your brand
                        heavily.
                    </p>
                    <li>Keyword- Approach</li>
                    <p>This strategy is similar to descriptive naming as using a keyword will describe your business. By
                        keyword, we mean a
                        relatable word to your business. For example, your industry type - accounting, finance or
                        marketing - can be in your
                        name. Such a strategy makes potential clients instantly recognize your brand. Besides, when you
                        get a domain name for
                        your business, this technique can improve your position in an online environment. Currently,
                        search engine algorithms
                        value the keywords in the website names and mark them ‘relatable’ for similar queries. Hence,
                        your brand can have a
                        slight advantage over its competitors and get more online traffic with this keyword approach in
                        naming.

                <h3>Create a List</h3>
                <p>You do not need to choose one of those strategies from the beginning. The most creative ideas emerge
                    when you do not
                    limit yourself. Use different techniques and write down all the names that come to your mind. Later,
                    get the inputs from
                    your competitor and customer analysis. Refine your ideas based on these inputs. Choose the name that
                    is:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Short- up to three words</li>
                    <li>Easy to understand, type and pronounce</li>
                    <li>Meaningful and relatable</li>
                    <li>Creative, unique and catchy</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Test the Name</h3>
                <p>Before you finally choose the name, you need to test it. First, make sure that there are no legal
                    barriers to getting
                    the name. None would want to face legal charges after creating their brand. Second, check if the
                    name is suitable for
                    other mediums, such as your slogan, signature, and other design elements. Lastly, ask for the
                    feedback of your potential
                    clients. This process will help you understand how memorable and appealing is your brand name to the
                    customers. Such
                    feedback generation can be as simple as asking your existing clients on social media channels. If
                    your business is new,
                    you can also ask your friends or family members to evaluate the name. In short, their comments can
                    lead to new ideas or
                    aid you to adjust the name to the target audience.
